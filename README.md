Optionally, you can select additional tasks such as creating a desktop icon or adding VS Code to the PATH. Make your selections and click "Next".

After these steps, you should have VS Code installed and ready to run your device.

2. After installing Visual Studio Code on Windows 11, you can make necessary adjustments to the font size, indentation style, and line numbering in the settings JSON file that can be accessed through the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P). Install essential extensions to improve Git integration, such as GitLens for bracket highlighting, ESLint or Python for coding support, and Bracket Pair Colorizer for bracket highlighting. Set up the integrated terminal settings and alter the theme to make it more aesthetically pleasing. If you haven't done so, use Git commands to set up your Git credentials globally. Learn how to use the keyboard shortcuts menu ({File -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts}) to customize or become familiar with the default keybindings. You may also look into debugging setups and workspace-specific settings to optimize your VS Code development process.


3. The user interface of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is optimized for customization and productivity, with multiple key components situated in designated regions of the program. Together, these elements give VS Code users a versatile and effective workspace that improves navigation and offers extensive tooling support for a range of coding and development tasks.


Activity bar
Within VS Code, the Activity Bar offers instant access to many views and features. The file browser Explorer, search, source control (which integrates Git), run and debug, extensions (which allows you to manage installed extensions), and other functions are represented by the icons here. When you click on these icons, VS Code shifts its primary emphasis to the associated task. It is located vertically on the far left side of the window. 
Side bar
A variety of panels that offer tools and context for the current activity are housed in the Side Bar. Typical panels consist of:
Explorer: Shows your workspace's file and folder hierarchy for administration and navigation.
Search: Offers the ability to search through all of the files in your project or workspace.
Source Control: Provides interaction with repositories, changes visualization, commit history, and integration with version control systems such as Git.
Extensions: Allows searching for new extensions in the Extensions Marketplace and manages installed ones.
Run and Debug: Enables debugging configurations and shows script or application outputs while they are running.

It is located adjacent to the Activity Bar on the left side. 

Editor Group
Files that are opened for editing are located in one or more editor tabs that make up the Editor Group. Each tab can be used to edit multiple files at once by representing a file or a split view (when split horizontally or vertically). To change their focus between various files they are working on, users can move between tabs. It is located in the center of the VS Code interface.

Status bar
The Status Bar offers details and rapid access to several features, including:
Language Mode: Indicates the active file's current programming language mode.
Line Endings: Specifies the kind of line endings (such as CRLF or LF) that are being utilized in the current file.
Encoding: Displays the current file's character encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.).
Indentation: Shows the current file's indentation style and size.
Git Integration: Provides fast Git activities, like committing changes, and displays details about the active Git branch.
Errors and Warnings: Provides further details about the workspace and extensions, as well as any errors or warnings that may be present in the active file.

It is located at the bottom of the VS Code window.



4. With a searchable interface, the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is an effective tool that gives users access to a variety of commands and functions. It offers a rapid and effective method of executing operations without requiring you to remember keyboard shortcuts or browse menus.
To access the Command Palette in VS Code, you can use the following methods:
•	Keyboard Shortcut: Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
•	Menu Option: Click on View in the top menu, then select Command Palette...
Some Examples of Common Tasks Using the Command Palette include switching between file tabs, opening files or folders, running tasks, and changing settings.

5. Extensions are essential for expanding Visual Studio Code's (VS Code) functionality and enabling users to improve and tailor their development environment to their unique requirements and work processes. Roles of extensions in VS Code boost user productivity by enhancing functionality - Extensions customize Visual Studio Code for different programming languages and development contexts by adding new features, debuggers, themes, and more. Workflow Customisation - Users can personalize their coding experience by adding extensions to increase efficiency, linking with third-party technologies (such as Docker and Git), or automating repetitive operations. Community Contributions - A wide range of options are available to accommodate various needs and tastes because extensions are frequently created and maintained by the community in collaboration with both people and organizations.

The Extensions Marketplace is easily accessible from within VS Code and offers a browsing and search function for extensions. Browse options for users include Most Popular, Recommended, and by certain tags (such as Python, JavaScript, etc.).  To install an extension, users can click on the Extensions view icon in the Activity Bar (or use the Ctrl+Shift+X shortcut). Search for the desired extension by name or functionality. Click "Install" next to the extension's listing to add it to VS Code. The Extensions view is where you may manage installed extensions. If an extension isn't needed anymore or is causing problems, disable it or remove it. To guarantee you have the newest features and bug fixes, update extensions manually or allow automatic updates.

Some essential extensions for web development are ESLint - In web development, ESLint is frequently used to enforce coding standards and identify typical programming mistakes in TypeScript and JavaScript code. It supports the upkeep of consistent and high-quality code across projects, Debugger for Chrome - With the help of this extension, developers may use the Developer Tools in Google Chrome to debug TypeScript and JavaScript code right within VS Code. It is necessary for debugging and resolving problems with web applications, Auto Close Tag / Auto Rename Tag - By synchronizing tag renaming and automatically closing tags, these enhancements improve HTML and XML editing. By minimizing human tag handling and guaranteeing uniformity in the code structure, they increase efficiency. CSS Peek - Developers may rapidly view CSS class definitions from HTML or JavaScript files by using CSS Peek. It makes modifying styles and navigating around websites easier.

6. When opposed to utilizing an external terminal, using Visual Studio Code's (VS Code) integrated terminal has a number of benefits such as accessibility and convenience - Accessibility is improved by having the terminal inside of VS Code, especially for people who would like work mostly in a single application, live output and debugging - The integrated terminal allows for live output to be shown within VS Code when tasks or scripts are executing, which facilitates real-time debugging and feedback, contextual awareness - When the integrated terminal opens, it does so automatically at the project or workspace's root. 
Opening and using the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is straightforward. To open and access the terminal,  you simply open VS Code, Click on Terminal in the top menu, and select New Terminal (Or keyboard shortcut Ctrl+`). 

7.  To create a new file in VS Code, Click on the Explorer icon in the Activity Bar (usually the top icon that looks like a folder). Right-click on the folder where you want to create the file, then select New File from the context menu. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+N (Mac) to create a new file directly. To create a new folder, in the Explorer view, right-click on the parent directory where you want to create the folder. Choose New Folder from the context menu and give it a name.
To open files double-click on a file in the Explorer view to open it in the editor. Use the File -> Open... menu option or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+O (Mac) to browse and open files. To open a folder use the File -> Open Folder... menu option or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K Ctrl+O (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+K Cmd+O (Mac) to open an entire folder as a workspace in VS Code.
To rename a file or folder right-click on a file or folder in the Explorer view and select Rename, or simply click on the file/folder name to edit it directly. To move a file or folder drag and drop files or folders within the Explorer view to move them to different locations within your project directory. To delete a file or folder right-click on a file or folder and select Delete from the context menu to remove it. 
To navigate between files and directories you can utilize the Explorer View. The Explorer view, which can be accessed from the Activity Bar, shows the folder and file hierarchy of your project. Utilize it to browse through various folders and double-click files to open them.
You can switch between open files by using Ctrl+Tab (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Tab (Mac) to quickly switch between open files in the editor. Alternatively, you can use Ctrl+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+P (Mac) to open the Quick Open feature, where you can start typing the file name to navigate directly to it. You can also use keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl+Shift+E (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+E (Mac) to toggle the Explorer view, or Ctrl+Shift+F (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+F (Mac) to search across files in the workspace.

8. Users can find and customize settings through various methods within the editor. To find and customize settings, access the setting menu by clicking on the gear icon ⚙️ in the bottom left corner of the Activity Bar to open the Settings. Here, you can search for and modify various settings using a user-friendly interface.
